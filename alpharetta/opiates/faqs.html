                <h3 class="h3">What is detoxing from Opiates like?<br></h3>
                <div class="head-body">
                    <p>Withdrawing from opiates on your own is agonizing.<br></p>
                    <p>Common withdrawal symptoms include:<br></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Abdominal pain, with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea<br></li>
                        <li>Anxiety and agitation<br></li>
                        <li>Insomnia<br></li>
                        <li>Hot and cold flashes, with heavy sweating<br></li>
                        <li>Muscle aches<br></li>
                        <li>Incessant desire to take opiates, which will consume your every thought – and often cause a relapse<br></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>But at Sunrise Detox, your comfort and safety are priority, so you’ll go through a medical detox,&nbsp;<strong>which alleviates the symptoms above.</strong><br></p>
                    <p>Besides getting medication and around-the-clock supervision, you’ll also get counseling, which helps you better understand the ongoing recovery process and prevent a relapse.<br></p>
                    <p>You’ll have time to relax in a private or semi-private room and in one of the inviting lounge areas with wide-screen HDTV and digital cable. And, expect delicious and nutritious meals—all of which are designed to help you on your road
                        to recovery. Since you’re not at a hospital or a psychiatric ward, the doors are not locked. You’ll be treated like a welcomed guest here.<br></p>
                </div>
                <h3 class="h3">What are my payment options?</h3>
                <div class="head-body">
                    <p>Most insurance carriers cover heroin detox at Sunrise.&nbsp; When you call we'll check coverage for you.<br></p>
                    <p>The only thing we can’t accept is Medicaid or Medicare. Any amount that is not covered by insurance can be paid with a personal check or Visa, MasterCard or Discover.<br></p>
                </div>
                <h3 class="h3">Do you take Medicaid or Medicare?&nbsp;</h3>
                <div class="head-body">
                    <p>Unfortunately, we cannot accept Medicaid or Medicare because we're a private facility and we don't receive any government funding. If you don’t have coverage under a private insurance provider, you can pay cash or finance your treatment
                        on a credit card. Don’t let financial concerns prevent you from getting the help you need.<br></p>
                </div>
                <h3 class="h3">Will I be sick?</h3>
                <div class="head-body">
                    <p>No. This is why patients come to us. You’ll be in a relaxing environment, which includes medication to counteract your withdrawal symptoms. A team of trained professionals is available 24 hours a day, so you can rest assured that any
                        discomfort will be responded to quickly.<br></p>
                </div>
                <h3 class="h3">How do I know if I need detox?&nbsp;</h3>
                <div class="head-body">
                    <p>If you’re asking this question, you already know the answer. If opiates are affecting your job, your relationships, and/or your health, it’s time to get help.<br></p>
                    <p>Unsupervised withdrawal from opiates is agonizing, so talk to a trained addiction advisor to find out how to detox comfortably:&nbsp;<strong>(678) 257-4002</strong><br></p>
                </div>
                <h3 class="h3">How long will I be there?</h3>
                <div class="head-body">
                    <p>The time your body needs depends on:<br></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your age and health<br></li>
                        <li>The amount of painkillers you take<br></li>
                        <li>The length of time you’ve been taking them<br></li>
                        <li>Whether you’ve been mixing them with other substances<br></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>An average stay is 7-10 days. A trained addiction advisor can give you a better idea of what to expect, depending on your specific situation.<br></p>
                </div>
                <h3 class="h3">Who else will be there?</h3>
                <div class="head-body">
                    <p>You’ll find people who:<br></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Truly want to get healthy<br></li>
                        <li>Want to do it in comfort<br></li>
                        <li>Can afford it<br></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If this sounds like you, try here first because this is where you want to be. If not, we can recommend facilities that are almost as nice.<br></p>
                    <p>We’re not a state-funded facility, so you won’t find people who are court-ordered to go to detox or who are on Medicare or Medicaid.<br></p>
                    <p>You will bond with other patients and staff at Sunrise, and you won't forget the positive experience that started your recovery.<br></p>
                </div>
                <h3 class="h3">Can I smoke?</h3>
                <div class="head-body">
                    <p>Yes. There are designated courtyard areas for smoking.<br><br></p>
                </div>
                <h3 class="h3">What should I bring?</h3>
                <div class="head-body">
                    <p>Feel free to bring any personal items that will make you feel most at home. Maybe books and magazines that you haven’t had time yet to read, or comfy slippers. You can wear your own clothing, and the private and semi-private suites
                        are equipped with closets and other space for your personal items.<br></p>
                    <p>Cell phones and personal computers are restricted, so you can focus on yourself and your recovery. You can bring your cell phone, but it will be secured in a safe with your other valuables. If you need to access your phone during your
                        stay, staff members can assist you. If you need to get online to check email, bank accounts or pay bills, the staff can help you with that, too.<br></p>
                </div>
                <h3 class="h3">What's the difference between detox and rehab?<br></h3>
                <div class="head-body">
                    <p>Detox lays the groundwork for a successful recovery by managing your body’s withdrawal from the opiates, which can be agonizing if not medically supervised. It normally takes about 7 - 10 days.<br></p>
                    <p>Rehab follows detox and gives a firmer foundation in which to build strategies for long-term recovery. Rehab often lasts 30 days.<br></p>
                    <p>Most rehab programs require inpatient opiate detox first. This is because they are really very different processes. In detox, you need to get the opiates completely out of your body and stop the overpowering craving that is consuming
                        your life before learning tools for long-term sobriety in rehab.<br></p>
                </div>
                <h3 class="h3">What if I need to detox from more than one substance?<br></h3>
                <div class="head-body">
                    <p>You can detox from other substances here, too, and avoid complications that can arise from withdrawing from more than one. This is because our clinic is also accredited to administer detox protocols for alcohol, benzodiazepines and
                        barbiturates.<br></p>
                    <p>Combining painkillers with other drugs and alcohol can be deadly, so detoxing from multiple substances should always be medically supervised. Notify the addiction advisor if this is the case when you call.<br></p>
                </div>
                <h3 class="h3">Is counseling required?<br></h3>
                <div class="head-body">
                    <p>Individual therapy is part of the opiate detox program. This will help you learn the skills needed to advance after detox and help you prepare for the next stage of treatment. Group therapy is also offered, but is optional.<br></p>
                </div>
                <h3 class="h3">How can I maximize my chance of success?<br></h3>
                <div class="head-body">
                    <p>First, you have to be ready to truly make a change. Given that, if you follow our proven opiate withdrawal protocols and the direction of the clinical staff, you will have the best chance for remaining sober.<br></p>
