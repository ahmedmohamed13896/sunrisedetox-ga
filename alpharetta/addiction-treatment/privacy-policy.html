            <h3 class="h3 h3-black"><br>PURPOSE OF POLICY<br></h3>
            <p class="body-text-dark">This Policy describes how Sunrise Detox ("us," "we" or "COMPANY") collects, uses and discloses personal information from you when you visit and use the SunriseDetox-ga.com website and Services (the "Site"). This Policy is only applicable to
                the Site, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Site, each of which may have data collection and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Policy.<br></p>
            <h3 class="h3 h3-black">NOTICE CONCERNING CHILDREN<br>PLEASE NOTE:<br><br></h3>
            <p class="body-text-dark">Our Site is operated for an adult audience only, and we require users to be at least 18 years of age. We do not intend for anyone under the age of 18 to use any of the features or services we offer from the Site, and we certainly do not direct
                any of our content specifically at children under 13 years of age. We understand and are committed to respecting the sensitive nature of children's privacy online.<br></p>
            <h3 class="h3 h3-black">INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES<br><br>INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE<br></h3>
            <p class="body-text-dark">In operating the Site, SunriseDetox-ga.com will collect personal information that you provide to us. For example, that may include registration, online surveys, and other online forms that ask users to provide their names, email addresses,
                other contact information, optional demographic information, listing love interests, recommending possible love interests for others, feedback, and voting.<br></p>
            <h3 class="h3 h3-black">INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY<br></h3>
            <p class="body-text-dark">When you visit or make use of the Site we may collect some information about you automatically. For example, our servers automatically recognize visitors' domain names and IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet). The
                Site may also gather "traffic data" that may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer.<br></p>
            <h3 class="h3 h3-black">COOKIES<br></h3>
            <p class="body-text-dark">We may use "cookies" (a small piece of data stored on your computer's hard drive). Cookies help us learn which areas of our site are useful and which areas need improvement. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings
                on your browser. However, if you choose to disable this function, your experience on the Site may be diminished and some features may not work as they were intended.<br></p>
            <h3 class="h3 h3-black">WEB BEACONS AND TRACKING PIXELS<br></h3>
            <p class="body-text-dark">We may use "web beacons" that will allow us to know if you've visited a certain page or opened an e-mail we've sent you. We may also use tracking pixels to allow us to show you better and more relevant advertising both on the Site and when
                you visit other websites.<br></p>
            <h3 class="h3 h3-black">SOCIAL NETWORKS<br></h3>
            <p class="body-text-dark">Our Site allows you to register using social networking platforms and to interact with and through those social networks. We may collect information you choose to allow us to access using those social networking platforms. We may track your
                check-ins and activities on and across our Sites, and on third party sites that use our services and compare them to others in the community. We may use this information to process and display your rankings, rewards, recognitions, virtual
                items and gifts and to perform analytics.<br></p>
            <h3 class="h3 h3-black">USE AND SHARING OF INFORMATION<br>WHAT DOES SUNRISE DETOX DO WITH COLLECTED INFORMATION?<br><br>PERSONAL INFORMATION.<br><br></h3>

                data to carry out their work for us, to protect the rights or property of Sunrise Detox, in an emergency to protect the personal safety of Sunrise Detox's employees, customers or any other person, to the extent required during the negotiation
                of a merger, sale, financing or acquisition, or to comply with the law. We may use your personal information to verify your identity, to check your qualifications, or to follow up with transactions initiated on the Site. We may also use
                your contact information to inform you of any changes to the Site, or to send you additional information about Sunrise Detox. If you provide your permission during the account registration process, we may share your contact information
                with our business partners or other companies so that they may send you promotional materials.<br></p>

                our site, or to display the content according to your preferences. Traffic and transaction information may also be shared with business partners and advertisers on an aggregate and anonymous basis.<br></p>

                customer information will be one of the assets transferred to the acquirer.<br></p>
